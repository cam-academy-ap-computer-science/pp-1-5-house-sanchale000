Good work!  Your program is very clean and well-organized.

For future projects, you will want to start adding comments.
Everybody does comments slightly differently, but comments
between the method calls for each verse would have helped
make the code more readable.

There is one efficiency that could be added.  Notice that
every time you call Malt2(), you call House2() immediately afterwards.
Therefore, you could add House2() at the end of your Malt2() method, and
remove it from the later verses.  Then, you could do the same thing
with Rat2 (add Malt2() at the end of it), etc.  Your last verse, then
would just be Maiden1() and Cow2(), and each verse would have just two
method calls for it.  No points off for that, but something to explore
for the future.

Great job!
